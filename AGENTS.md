# Repository Guidelines

These guidelines apply to L.O.S.E.: Lots of Outer Space to Explore â€” a Vite + React + TypeScript browser game. The world renders on an HTML5 canvas; menus/HUD use React. No server required.

## **DO NOT IGNORE: READ THE RULES DOC**

You MUST read `RULES.md` before starting ANY task. If I make it clear that I have a general code preference, you MUST record it in the code rules doc. That document will make you a better programmer. Treat it like gospel.
