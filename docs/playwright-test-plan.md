# Playwright UI & Gameplay Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for setting up Playwright test suites to cover the main UI functionality and gameplay of the Lose Game project. The goal is to create modular, maintainable, and minimal-mocking tests for:

- HUD (Heads-Up Display)
- Core gameplay interactions

## Principles

- **Minimal Mocking:** Prefer real interactions over mocks/stubs.
- **Modular Structure:** Organize tests by feature/component.
- **Simplicity:** Keep test setup and assertions straightforward.
- **Maintainability:** Use clear naming and structure for easy updates.

## Test Suite Structure

### 1. HUD Tests

- Verify HUD renders on game start
- Check HUD panels (score, health, notifications, etc.)
- Interact with HUD controls (settings, speed, etc.)
- Validate HUD updates in response to gameplay events

### 2. Gameplay Tests

- Start a new game session
- Simulate player input (keyboard/mouse)
- Validate game state changes (score, health, etc.)
- Test win/lose conditions
- Interact with game objects (planets, ships, etc.)

### 3. End-to-End Flow

- Full game session from start to finish
- Pause/resume functionality
- Settings modal interactions

## Organization

- Place Playwright test files in `e2e/` directory
- Use one file per major feature/component (e.g., `hud.spec.ts`, `gameplay.spec.ts`)
- Shared helpers/utilities in `e2e/utils/`

## Next Steps

1. Scaffold test files in `e2e/`
2. Implement HUD test cases
3. Implement gameplay test cases
4. Add shared test utilities
5. Document test setup and running instructions
