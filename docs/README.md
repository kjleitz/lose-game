# docs/

Project documentation and architectural decision records.

## Structure

- **`adr/`** - Architectural Decision Records documenting important technical decisions

## Purpose

This directory contains:

- Technical documentation
- Architecture guides
- Decision records explaining why certain approaches were chosen
- Setup and development guides
- API documentation

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during development. Each ADR explains:

- The context and problem being solved
- Decision made and alternatives considered
- Consequences and trade-offs
- Current status (proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded)

ADRs help future developers understand the reasoning behind technical choices and provide context for refactoring decisions.

## Guidelines

- Keep documentation focused and actionable
- Update docs when making significant architectural changes
- Use markdown for consistency and readability
- Link to relevant code when explaining concepts
