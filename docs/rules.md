# Project Rules

These are the guiding principles for development in this repo. Keep them short, explicit, and enforceable.

## Canonical Rules

- Remove legacy code promptly. Do not keep old paths or duplicate logic "just in case" or to appease stale tests.
- Tests are there to validate the application. The application is not there to validate the tests.
  - If a test enshrines behavior we no longer want, change or delete the test alongside the code change.
  - Do not retain legacy code paths solely to keep tests green.

## Architecture Migration

- When introducing a new architecture or subsystem (e.g., ECS planet mode), deprecate and remove the old implementation (e.g., legacy `PlanetGame`/`GameManager`) once the replacement is stable.
- Temporary duplication during migration is acceptable only with an explicit, near-term removal plan (tracked issue or PR checklist).
  - Current status: Legacy classes (`PlanetGame`, `SpaceGame`, `GameManager`, engine/core) have been removed. Modes are states inside `GameSessionECS` and share canonical `PlanetSurface` types.

## Input and Settings Changes

- If key bindings or settings change, provide a one-time migration for persisted data (e.g., remap old keys). Do not revert product changes to satisfy historical tests.

## Testing Philosophy

- Keep tests aligned with the intended product behavior. Prefer high-value, integration-style tests at stable boundaries.
- When refactoring, update tests to reflect the new design; do not preserve obsolete seams.
- Unit tests should live right next to the file they cover, and should be named the same as the file but suffixed with `.test.ts(x)` instead of `.ts(x)`. For example: unit tests for `src/foo/Bar.ts` should live in `src/foo/Bar.test.ts`, NOT in some separate `src/foo/tests` directory.
- We want comprehensive unit tests which test INTENDED behavior (not just EXISTING behavior... which may actually be broken in some cases! We'll find out when we write tests against INTENDED BEHAVIOR.)

## Enforcement

- PRs that add duplicate logic must include a removal plan (owner + date). Prefer extracting shared helpers over duplication.
  - Do not duplicate structural types (e.g., `PlanetSurface`) in renderers or systems; import the canonical type.

## Style and Naming

- No one-letter identifiers. Use descriptive variable, parameter, and function names for readability.
- Allowed exceptions: loop indices `i`/`j`/`k` and coordinates `x`/`y`.
- ESLint enforces `id-length` with min 2, excluding properties; `_` is allowed as a throwaway placeholder.
- Tests are allowed to use short identifiers when it meaningfully improves brevity (e.g., tiny helpers); the linter permits this only in `*.test.ts[x]` files.
- Vendored or internal library code under `src/lib/**` is ignored by the linter; keep local app code clean.
- For canvas transforms, avoid `a..f`â€”prefer descriptive names (e.g., `m11`, `m12`, `dx`, `dy`).
