> Let's get started on the dual game system

⏺ I'd be happy to help you get started on the dual game system! However, I need a bit more context to provide the most helpful assistance.

  Could you clarify what you mean by "dual game system"? Are you looking to:

  - Implement multiplayer functionality with two players?
  - Create a split-screen or dual-view system?
  - Add a second game mode alongside the existing space exploration?
  - Something else entirely?

  Once I understand your specific goals, I can help plan and implement the dual game system for your L.O.S.E. space exploration game.

  ⎿  Read docs/decisions/adr-0008-engine-extraction-plan.md (409 lines)

⏺ I can see you have a comprehensive ADR-0008 that outlines an ambitious engine extraction plan for creating a true dual-game architecture! This is a well-thought-out
   design that would separate SpaceGame and PlanetGame into independent implementations sharing a common engine.

     ☐ Create implementation roadmap based on current state vs ADR vision

⏺ Perfect! After analyzing your codebase, I can see you're already well-positioned to implement the engine extraction plan from ADR-0008. Here's my assessment:

  Current State vs ADR Vision

  ✅ Already Implemented:
  - Game Mode System: You have GameMode abstract class with SpaceMode and PlanetMode implementations
  - Mode Transitions: ModeTransitionManager handles switching between space/planet
  - Separated Concerns: Each mode manages its own entities (enemies, projectiles, terrain)
  - Input System: InputManager is already abstracted and reusable
  - Rendering Pipeline: Modular renderers (GameRenderer, ShipRenderer, EnemyRenderer, etc.)

  🔧 Ready for Extraction:
  - InputManager in src/application/game/ → easily movable to src/engine/input/
  - Rendering system in src/domain/render/ → can become src/engine/rendering/
  - Camera system already abstracted in src/domain/render/camera.ts

  📋 Implementation Roadmap:

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Review current codebase structure to understand existing dual-game implementation
     ☒ Assess feasibility of Phase 1 engine extraction (InputManager, core interfaces)
     ☒ Create implementation roadmap based on current state vs ADR vision
     ☐ Create engine directory structure
     ☐ Move InputManager to engine/input/
     ☐ Create Game interface and GameEngine interfaces
     ☐ Move rendering system to engine/rendering/
     ☐ Convert SpaceMode to SpaceGame implementing Game interface
     ☐ Convert PlanetMode to PlanetGame implementing Game interface
     ☐ Create GameManager to orchestrate engine and games
     ☐ Update GameSession to use GameManager
     ☐ Update UI components to work with new architecture
     ☐ Run tests and fix any regressions

⏺ Recommended Approach:

  Your codebase is in an excellent position to implement the ADR-0008 vision. The existing GameMode system is essentially the Game interface already, and you have
  clean separation of concerns.

  Phase 1 (Start Here): Extract core engine systems that are already well-abstracted:
  1. Create src/engine/ structure
  2. Move InputManager → src/engine/input/
  3. Move rendering system → src/engine/rendering/
  4. Create GameEngine interface to wrap these systems

  Phase 2: Convert existing modes to games:
  1. SpaceMode → SpaceGame (minimal changes needed)
  2. PlanetMode → PlanetGame (minimal changes needed)
  3. Create GameManager to replace the mode-switching logic in GameSession

  The beauty is that your current architecture already follows the ADR's principles - you just need to reorganize the directory structure and create the engine
  abstraction layer.

  Would you like me to start with Phase 1 and create the engine directory structure and move the InputManager?
