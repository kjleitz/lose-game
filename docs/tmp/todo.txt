from src/application/GameManager.ts:

```ts
get planets(): Planet[] {
  const space = this.games.get("space");
  return space instanceof SpaceGame ? space.planetsData : [];
}
```

this is smelly.

1. why return empty array object? changes will get thrown away if it's mutated. It should throw an error or something if `space` is nullish
2. why check `space` with `instanceof`? If it's something else, it should DEFINITELY be an error, because that would be very strange for something else to be stored under the `'space'` key.
3. This should not be a getter. Let's not use getters and setters. I used to like them, but I've slowly become convinced they only ever create headaches.

I see a lot of this in that file.
